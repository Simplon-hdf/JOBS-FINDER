# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: VALIDATE-FRONTEND

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can #access it(copy all the source code in the repo)
      - name: Get code from github repository and download it into the actuel runner
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install NodeJS #Nodejs is preinstalled in the runner, but we installed manually here to practice
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci #npm install Or npm CI(to install the dependencies locked into package-lock.js, so it's better then npm install, that's make us sure that we are using the same version that we used during the development)
      - name: Run tests
        run: ng test
